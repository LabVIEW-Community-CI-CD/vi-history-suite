# Test Plan

## Overview

- Release or baseline: `draft-baseline`
- Owner: sole author
- Scope: first governed extension baseline for content-detected VI history
  review

## Test Items

| Item | Type | Risk | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| VI magic detection | Unit | High | Product entry condition |
| Git output parsing | Unit | High | Eligibility correctness |
| History panel rendering | Unit | Medium | Primary review surface |
| Extension activation and command flow | Integration | High | VS Code runtime behavior |
| Harness smoke against cloned real repo | Integration | High | Real history path |

## Entry Criteria

- requirements and traceability are current
- TypeScript compiles
- unit test fixtures are present

## Exit Criteria

- unit tests pass
- extension compiles cleanly
- local coverage is generated
- no blocking defect is left in the initial command or history flow

## Coverage Targets

| Metric | Target | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Line | 80% | `coverage/cobertura-coverage.xml` |
| Branch | Project-defined by Vitest | `coverage/coverage-summary.json` |

## Initial Test Cases

- `TEST-UNIT-001`: detect `LVIN` and `LVCC`, reject short files, reject wrong
  offsets, and exercise strict-header mode
- `TEST-UNIT-002`: parse `git ls-files -z`, bounded commit-hash output, and
  history-entry output
- `TEST-UNIT-003`: prove cache-key and concurrency helpers behave deterministically
- `TEST-UNIT-004`: render a history panel with factual metadata and action hooks
- `TEST-INTEG-001`: activate extension, compute eligibility context, and open
  the history panel for an eligible file
- `TEST-INTEG-002`: validate non-file URI detection fallback behavior

## Reporting

- CI artifacts: `coverage/`
- Test report location: Vitest console output plus coverage summary
